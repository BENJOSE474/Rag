Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. \\nJobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company\\'s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he bought the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, which was spun off independently as Pixar. Pixar produced the first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story (1995), and became a leading animation studio, producing dozens of commercially successful and critically acclaimed films.\\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company\\'s acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. Jobs was also a board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.

      "## When Was Steve Jobs Fired From Apple?\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a lot of historical nuance to Steve Jobs' departure from Apple, so it's important to be precise. While the term \"fired\" is often used, it's not entirely accurate. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple on September 17, 1985.**  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the circumstances surrounding his exit were complex.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Leading up to 1985:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Internal Power Struggles:** Jobs, known for his visionary leadership and demanding nature, clashed with Apple's board of directors and CEO John Sculley. This friction stemmed from philosophical differences regarding Apple's direction, particularly the company's focus on the Macintosh computer line against the more popular and profitable IBM-compatible machines.\n",
      "* **Financial Challenges:** Apple faced declining profits and market share in the mid-1980s. The Macintosh, while innovative, proved commercially challenging due to its high price and limited software ecosystem.  \n",
      "* **Sculley's Influence:** Sculley, hired by Jobs in 1983, eventually sided with the board, believing that Apple needed to prioritize profitability over Jobs' ambitious, but potentially risky, product strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The \"Coup\":**\n",
      "\n",
      "On September 17, 1985, the board of directors, led by Sculley, voted to remove Jobs from his position as CEO and chairman. Jobs was effectively marginalized within Apple, stripped of his responsibilities and relegated to a more symbolic advisory role.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Aftermath:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Job's Departure:** Within a few weeks, Jobs resigned from Apple. \n",
      "* **NeXT and Pixar:**  Jobs went on to found NeXT, a computer company focused on high-end workstations, and acquired Pixar, a computer animation studio that would become a major force in the entertainment industry.  \n",
      "* **Apple's Acquisition of NeXT:**  In 1997, Apple, struggling to regain its footing, acquired NeXT. This brought Jobs back to Apple, this time as CEO, setting the stage for his remarkable second act and Apple's future dominance in the tech world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While \"fired\" might be a simplistic label, it captures the essence of a dramatic event that marked a turning point in Steve Jobs' career and the history of Apple. It's a story of ambition, rivalry, and ultimately, redemption.  \n",
      "\n"

He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. \\nJobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI.
