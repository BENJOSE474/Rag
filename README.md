# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architecture that combines **information retrieval** with **large language models (LLMs)** to provide accurate, context-aware, and up-to-date responses.  
Instead of relying solely on the LLM's internal knowledge, RAG fetches relevant documents from an external knowledge base and feeds them into the generation process.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Document Retrieval**: Search and retrieve the most relevant passages from your knowledge base.  
- 🧠 **Context-Aware Generation**: Combine retrieved knowledge with LLMs for factual and grounded responses.  
- 📚 **Custom Knowledge Base**: Plug in PDFs, text files, or databases.  
- ⚡ **Framework Ready**: Built with modern libraries such as [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph), or [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/).  
- ✅ **Evaluation**: Use tools like [DeepEval](https://docs.confident-ai.com/deepeval/) or [Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/) to validate response quality.
