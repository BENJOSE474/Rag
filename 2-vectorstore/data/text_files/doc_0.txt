The solar system is a collection of celestial bodies bound together by the gravitational pull of the Sun. At its center lies the Sun, a massive star that provides the light and heat necessary for life on Earth. Surrounding it are eight planets, each with unique characteristics. The inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are rocky and relatively small. The outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are much larger and composed mostly of gas and ice.
In addition to the planets, the solar system contains moons, asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets like Pluto. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is home to thousands of rocky bodies, while the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud contain icy objects at the edges of the system. Scientists study the solar system to understand not only the origins of Earth but also the possibilities of life beyond our planet.
