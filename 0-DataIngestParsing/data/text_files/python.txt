Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.AI LLM Security Session Summary
This session covers real-world security risks in Large Language Model (LLM) deployments, drawn from penetration testing and recent research. Attendees will learn about key vulnerabilities, see a live demo of a novel prompt extraction attack (revealing system prompts without model access), and understand why traditional security tools fall short. The talk also covers how attackers exploit generative AI and provides practical defenses to strengthen AI LLM security posture.

Why Attend:

Understand common vulnerabilities in LLM applications.

Learn from Black Hat trainers and pen testers real-world findings.

See live demonstrations of prompt-based attacks.

Gain actionable strategies to defend against AI-specific threats.
